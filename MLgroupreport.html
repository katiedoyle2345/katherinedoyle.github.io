                <section>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The landscape of the retail sector is constantly evolving. Demand forecasting is the process of leveraging tools to estimate the future demand for products. The goal of demand forecasting is to help businesses make data-driven decisions for their business strategy, particularly with inventory management and production planning. The complexities of understanding and identifying customer preferences and seamlessly delivering personalised interactions pose a challenging task for retailers. Finding the right balance is difficult to achieve, as traditional methods can hinder their efforts to understand the evolution of consumer behaviour, particularly as the world becomes more digital. The emergence of machine learning has been a pivotal force in how businesses manage their inventory levels and enhance their customer journeys seamlessly through various channels.</p>

                    <h2>Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering Methods</h2>
                    <p>Data quality is critical in retail as large quantities of complex data can be dirty. Cleaning this data is vital to improving its accuracy. Standardisation of data through z-score analysis and standardising customer information are necessary steps to improve the accuracy of predictive analytics. Features like lag features from past sales data and rolling statistics are used to understand and predict sales trends better.</p>

                    <h2>Chosen Model – Random Forests</h2>
                    <p>The Random Forest algorithm is a regression tree technique that consists of a series of tree classifiers. This model is known for its high classification accuracy and its ability to tolerate outliers, which makes it particularly useful in the retail sector for demand forecasting.</p>

						<section>
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>Random Forests offer a robust solution for retail demand forecasting by effectively capturing intricate non-linear relationships in demand data. Their resilience to noisy datasets ensures reliability by preventing undue influence from outliers or short-term anomalies. The model's versatility shines through in its ability to handle diverse features, both numerical and categorical, without requiring extensive feature engineering. Random Forests prove adept at automatically identifying and adapting to seasonal variations, crucial in the context of retail demand influenced by factors such as holidays, weather, and cultural events. The feature importance ranking provided by Random Forests empowers retailers to understand and prioritize key drivers of demand, optimizing inventory management and marketing strategies accordingly.</p>

						<section>
							<h2>Actionable Recommendations</h2>
							<p>Retailers should integrate Random Forests into their operations to enhance accuracy in demand forecasting and adapt their models regularly to stay relevant in the changing market. Collaboration between data scientists and domain experts in retail is vital as combining technical expertise with industry insights can enhance the interpretability of the model's results and foster a deeper understanding of retail-specific nuances.</p>
						</section>
			
						<section>
							<h2>Suggestions for Future Research</h2>
							<p>Future research could explore enhancing the interpretability of ensemble models and investigating methods to dynamically update feature importance as demand patterns evolve. Additionally, integrating Random Forests with emerging technologies such as reinforcement learning and deep learning could further enhance forecasting capabilities, especially in scenarios with high-dimensional and complex data.</p>
