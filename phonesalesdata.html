                    <h2>Data Quality and Processing</h2>
                   <p>The integration of Power BI visualisations with the <strong><a href="Sales.csv" target="_blank">"Sales.csv"</a></strong> dataset and Python analysis enriches the analysis by offering dynamic insights. The visualisations provide a multi-dimensional view of market dynamics, underscoring the importance of visual analytics in deriving actionable business intelligence.</p>

                    <p>Data processing and feature engineering, such as standardising formats and handling missing values, directly impact model performance. These steps ensure the dataset is clean, uniform, and ready for analysis, crucial for building accurate and reliable predictive models.</p>

                    <h2>What I did to clean the Sales Date</h2>
                    <p>
			Dataset Initialization: Sales data was imported into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file, ensuring correct parsing and readiness for manipulation.<br>
			Data Cleanup: Column headers were standardized by removing spaces, and rows with missing values were eliminated to maintain dataset integrity for reliable analysis.<br>
			Data Standardization: Memory and storage information were normalized to a uniform numeric format, crucial for enabling accurate quantitative comparisons.<br>
			Feature Engineering: Additional calculations were performed to derive new columns, such as discount percentages, improving the dataset's utility for analysis.<br>
			Currency Standardization: Prices were converted from INR to EUR for consistency, with the conversion ensuring the data aligns with the analysis's geographic focus.<br>
			Data Pruning: Columns containing original currency values were removed post-conversion, streamlining the dataset to include only relevant data.<br>
			Data Export: The refined dataset, now clean and processed, was exported as a new CSV file, ready for comprehensive analysis or further reporting. </section>

                    <h2>Analytics: Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning</h2>
                    <p>The heatmap displays the correlation matrix for selected features, providing insights into the relationships between memory, storage, pricing, and ratings. This analysis identifies key influencers on product ratings and guides strategic decisions.</p>
                    <p>Machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting, have been employed to predict mobile phone ratings based on specifications and prices. The models' performance, indicated by RMSE and R^2 Score, reveals the predictive power and areas for further improvement.</p>

                    <h3>What I did in the Python Code:</h3>
                    <pre><code>
# Sample Python code snippet for data cleaning
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculating the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = cleaned_data[['Memory', 'Storage', 'SellingPrice_EUR', 'OriginalPrice_EUR', 'Rating']].corr()

# Plotting the heatmap for the correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f")
plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Features')
plt.show()
                    </code></pre>
