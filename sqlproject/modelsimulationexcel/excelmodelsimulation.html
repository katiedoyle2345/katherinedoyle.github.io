							<h1>Model Simulation for Airline Overbooking Strategies</h1>
							<p>This portfolio entry showcases a comprehensive simulation model developed to analyze overbooking strategies within the airline industry. Overbooking is a common practice among airlines to mitigate the impact of no-show passengers, but it must be balanced against the risk of denying boarding to passengers when more show up than there are seats available.</p>
							<h2> Techniques Used:</h2>
							<p>Data Analysis: The "Flight Data" sheet shows initial data analysis to better understand the flight operations, including the collection and cleansing of flight-related data.</p>
							<p>Probabilistic Modeling: In "Model 1 (1 Overbooking)" and "Model 2 (3 Overbookings)", probabilistic models were constructed to simulate different scenarios of overbooking. The models utilise historical data to estimate probabilities of no-shows and to calculate optimal overbooking levels.</p>
							<p>Scenario Analysis: By comparing different models with varying degrees of overbooking, a scenario analysis was conducted to observe the outcomes under different conditions and to identify the overbooking strategy that maximises revenue while minimising the risk and cost of denied boarding.</p>
							<p>Revenue Management: The simulation addresses revenue management by forecasting potential revenue gains from overbooking against the costs associated with compensating bumped passengers.</p>

						<h2>Statistical Analysis: Message length distribution by class</h2>
						<p>This histogram displays the distribution of message lengths for both spam and ham messages. It helps in understanding whether the length of a message can be an indicative feature of whether it's spam.</p>
						<p>By comparing the length distribution between spam and ham messages, insights can be gained about typical message lengths for each category. For example, spam messages might tend to be shorter or longer than ham messages, which could be a useful feature for classification models.</p>

						<h2> Confusion Matrix Visualisation:</h2>
						<p> The confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It shows the model's predictions in relation to actual labels.
							The matrix provides four outcomes - true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). This visualization helps in assessing how many messages were correctly or incorrectly classified as spam or ham, providing a clear picture of the model's performance, particularly its errors.</p>
						<p><stromg>True Negatives (TN):</stromg>The model correctly identified 965 non-spam messages. This is a high number and suggests that the model is very effective at identifying the majority of genuine messages.</p>	
						<p>False Negatives (FN): There are 38 instances where spam messages were incorrectly labeled as non-spam. While relatively low, this number suggests that some spam messages are still managing to get through the filter.</p>	
						<p>True Positives (TP): There are 112 instances where the model correctly identified spam messages. This number is considerably lower than the TNs, which might be expected as spam messages are generally less frequent than non-spam.</p>
						<p>False Positives (FP): The model did not incorrectly label any non-spam messages as spam. This indicates excellent precision; legitimate messages are not being mistakenly blocked.

							<h2> Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve:</h2>
						<p>The ROC curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) at various threshold settings.
							The area under the ROC curve (AUC) gives a single measure of overall model performance across all classification thresholds. The closer the ROC curve is to the upper left corner, the better the model's performance. A model with perfect discrimination (no overlap between the two distributions) has an AUC of 1.0.</p>
