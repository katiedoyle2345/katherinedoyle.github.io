							<h2>Killester Basketball</h2>
							<p>Since I was 10, basketball has been a big part of my life and and my dedication to the sport has paralleled the commitment I bring to my professional career. I play on the ladies D2 team at my local club Killester . On the court with , I've learned the importance of agility, strategic thinking, and the power of collective effort, all attributes that have immensely contributed to my professional life.</p>
							<p>In basketball, you have to watch what the other team is doing and be ready to change your plan in a moment. At work, I plan to do the same thing. Whether I'm playing as a guard or a forward in basketball, I bring the same leadership and energy to my job every day.</p>
							<p>Playing basketball has shown me that when everyone brings their own skills to the team, we can do amazing things together. This is true for my work and college projects too. When we all work together, we come up with great ideas and get things done well.</p>
							<p>I've included two pictures: one of me in the middle of a game, which shows how I tackle challenges head-on, and another of my whole basketball team, showing how I value teamwork at work just as much as I do in sports.</p>
