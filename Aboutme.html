							<h1>About Me ....</h1>
							<h2>Welcome to my portfolio !</h2>
							<p>This portfolio is a practical display of my journey in data analytics. Here you will find a selection of projects that showcase my skills in python, SQL, and Power BI.  Each project illustrates how I approach data with a sharp analytical eye and solve problems to provide clear, actionable insights.</p>
							<p>My Journey in the data analytics world began in my early teens when my mother would bring me to Coder Dojo in DCU on a Saturday morning. This was my introduction to the brilliance of computers.
								During my undergraduate studies at DCU I came to understand the significance and enormous potential of data analytics in business. This ignited my passion for this field, inspiring me to specialise in the subject in final year. 
							</p>
							<p>As an undergraduate I immerse myself in relevant coursework, including creating a Professional Data Analytics Portfolio, which showcases my skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, statistical analysis, data visualisations and predictive modelling.</p>
							<p>My enthusiasm for data analytics was further nurtured during my internship at Johnson & Johnson, where I worked on projects that involved extracting valuable insights from large datasets and presenting these findings in a visually appealing way. I created multiple reports each month including the Daily Sales Report, Mass Sales Report, T&R report and any field sales reports that the pharmacy sales reps requested. I used many types of software such as BI, SAP and Dunhumby. The opportubity to apply my skills to solve tangible business problems reinforced my commitment to pursuing a career in data analytics.</p>
