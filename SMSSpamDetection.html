							<h1>SMS Spam Detection Using Natural Language Processing</h1>
							<h2>Aim of the Project:</h2>
							<p>The project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model will process and analyze text data to identify patterns indicative of unsolicited messages. The objective is to enhance the filtering of spam messages, thereby improving user experience and security.</p>
							<h2> Explanation and Rationale:</h2>
							<p>The project follows a standard NLP pipeline, which includes data loading, text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.</p>
							<p>1.Data Loading: The first step involves loading the <strong><a href="spam_sms.csv" target="_blank">"SMS_Spam.csv"</a></strong>  dataset using pandas, a Python library for data manipulation and analysis. This step is crucial to get a preliminary look at the data and understand the structure and content of the SMS messages.</p>
							<p>2.Text Preprocessing: Since machine learning models do not understand raw text, we perform preprocessing to convert text into a more digestible format. <br>
							This includes:<br>
   									 - Removing punctuation and numbers to reduce noise in the data.<br>
   									 - Converting all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.<br>
  									 - Tokenising the text into individual words to prepare for further cleaning.<br>
    									 - Removing common stopwords (e.g., "and", "the", "is") which do not contribute to distinguishing spam messages.<br>
    									 - Applying stemming to words to reduce them to their root form, thus consolidating similar forms of a word.</p>
							<p>3.Feature Extraction: We convert the preprocessed text into numerical values using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique. TF-IDF evaluates how important a word is to a document within a large collection of documents (corpus). It gives more weight to terms that are frequent in a document but not across documents. This step transforms text data into a format that machine learning algorithms can work with.</p>
							<p>4.Model Training: With the features ready, we train a Naive Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for text classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness. It uses probabilities to make predictions, which is particularly suitable for spam detection as it can manage the independence between the words after the TF-IDF transformation.</p>
							<p>5.Model Evaluation: After training, we evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to determine its accuracy and the precision and recall of its predictions. This step is critical to assess the modelâ€™s practicality in effectively filtering spam messages without misclassifying legitimate messages (ham).</p>
							<p>6.Application: The final product is a spam detection model that can be integrated into messaging platforms to automatically filter out spam, thus protecting users from unwanted messages and potential phishing attempts.</p>
						<p>By addressing a common and impactful problem, this project not only demonstrates the application of NLP in a practical scenario but also showcases the ability to harness machine learning for improving digital communication security. </p>

						<h2>Statistical Analysis: Message length distribution by class</h2>
						<p>This histogram displays the distribution of message lengths for both spam and ham messages. It helps in understanding whether the length of a message can be an indicative feature of whether it's spam.</p>
						<p>By comparing the length distribution between spam and ham messages, insights can be gained about typical message lengths for each category. For example, spam messages might tend to be shorter or longer than ham messages, which could be a useful feature for classification models.</p>

						<h2> Confusion Matrix Visualisation:</h2>
						<p> The confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It shows the model's predictions in relation to actual labels.
							The matrix provides four outcomes - true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). This visualization helps in assessing how many messages were correctly or incorrectly classified as spam or ham, providing a clear picture of the model's performance, particularly its errors.</p>
						<p><stromg>True Negatives (TN):</stromg>The model correctly identified 965 non-spam messages. This is a high number and suggests that the model is very effective at identifying the majority of genuine messages.</p>	
						<p>False Negatives (FN): There are 38 instances where spam messages were incorrectly labeled as non-spam. While relatively low, this number suggests that some spam messages are still managing to get through the filter.</p>	
						<p>True Positives (TP): There are 112 instances where the model correctly identified spam messages. This number is considerably lower than the TNs, which might be expected as spam messages are generally less frequent than non-spam.</p>
						<p>False Positives (FP): The model did not incorrectly label any non-spam messages as spam. This indicates excellent precision; legitimate messages are not being mistakenly blocked.

							<h2> Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve:</h2>
						<p>The ROC curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) at various threshold settings.
							The area under the ROC curve (AUC) gives a single measure of overall model performance across all classification thresholds. The closer the ROC curve is to the upper left corner, the better the model's performance. A model with perfect discrimination (no overlap between the two distributions) has an AUC of 1.0.</p>
